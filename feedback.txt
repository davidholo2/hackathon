This game is truly engaging! Game coding can easily become disorganized, 
so I recommend using more comments for clarity. Decorators could also be beneficial in this case. 
You've used OOP effectively, but the use of an API (to offer some form of reward to the winner, 
for example) and a database (for login and score storage) could enhance the game. 
Please add a requirements.txt with instructions and necessary modules respectively.
